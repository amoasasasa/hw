1) function to view vimdiff.
requirements == todays date, directory path, file names (one normal and other one with date)

date == from mflags 
filenames = no no we dont have to add extension to them just use wildcard .??? and .???_$date
for multiple backup files we have to ask user for input which file user want we will show the user which file are present if that count is greater than 3 
we will show filenames first then ask user to select the filename then we will update the codename_bkp variable with new value..	
		first we will go to the directory then for loop will read file names one by one 
		
		for i in $filename
		do
		codename="$i.???"
		codename_bkp="$codename_$date*"
		local file_cnt=`ls -lrt $codename $codename_bkp|wc -l`
		if [ file_cnt > 2 ]
		then
			echo "There are more backup files for present date. Below is the list of files"
			ls -lrt $codename_bkp
			echo "please select which file do you want to select to compare?"
			read $codename_bkp
		
		echo "showing vimdiff for $codename and $codename_bkp. Press enter"
		read 
		vimdiff $codename $codename_bkp
		
done
